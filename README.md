# ML-Bachelors-project
My bachelors project for my engineering physics degree.
The project revolved around reducing the peak consumptions (kW) of several school kitchens around the city of Uppsala.
The schools were equipped with controllabe batteries connected to solar panels. Using historical data of power consumption
as well as data gathered from solar panels, I was able to develop a new algorithm for controlling the battery that was able
to reallocate the discharge time for heavier loads using machine learning.
The repo contains the data used as well as the code for processing the data, training the models and analyzing the results.
